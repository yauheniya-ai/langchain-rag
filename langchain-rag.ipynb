    "LangChainâ€™s `Document` is a data structure for handling text chunks. It typically represents a portion of a larger document and includes the following attributes:\n",
    "\n",
    "- `id`: optional unique identifier\n",
    "- `metadata`: a dictionary with source info or context\n",
    "- `page_content`: the text content itself (required)\n",
    "- `type`: new addition for the document type, e.g. Document or TextChunk\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "LangChain supports various [PDF loaders](https://python.langchain.com/docs/integrations/document_loaders/#pdfs), ranging from basic text extractors to advanced tools with OCR and layout analysis, allowing users to choose based on their specific needs:\n",
    "\n",
    "- `PyPDFLoader`: best all-around for academic or structured PDFs. Great for research papers, reports, and text-based documents.\n",
    "- `Unstructured`: best for scanned PDFs (with OCR support). Great for invoices, scanned forms, mixed-content files.\n",
    "- `MathPix`: extracts math formulas, LaTeX, and figures well. Ideal for scientific articles, research papers with math.\n",
    "- `PDFPlumber`: strong at extracting tables and structured data. Use when you care about exact layout or tabular info.\n",
    "\n",
    "[PyPDFLoader](https://python.langchain.com/docs/integrations/document_loaders/pypdfloader/) reads text from PDFs and returns one Document per page, with the text in `page_content`. When creating Document objects, PyPDFLoader typically tries to extract the human-readable `page_label` if it exists; otherwise, it falls back to a 1-based page number (i.e., index + 1)."
